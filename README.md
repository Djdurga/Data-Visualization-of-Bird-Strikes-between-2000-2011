# Data Visualization of Bird Strikes (2000 – 2011)

## Project Overview

**Title:** Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011  
**Domain:** Transportation and Communication  
**Technologies:** Data Science (Python, Tableau, Power BI, etc.)  
**Difficulty Level:** Advanced  

## Problem Statement

The project aims to analyze and visualize data on bird strikes collected by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) from 2000 to 2011. Bird strikes pose significant threats to aircraft safety, and understanding the patterns and impacts of these incidents is crucial for improving safety measures.

## Key Questions and Analysis Objectives

1. **Visuals Depicting the Number of Bird Strikes:**
   - Create visualizations showing the total number of bird strikes over the years.

2. **Yearly Analysis & Bird Strikes in the US:**
   - Analyze the data to show the yearly trends of bird strikes.

3. **Top 10 US Airlines in Terms of Bird Strikes:**
   - Identify which airlines have encountered the most bird strikes.

4. **Airports with Most Incidents of Bird Strikes – Top 50:**
   - Determine which airports have reported the highest number of bird strikes.

5. **Yearly Cost Incurred Due to Bird Strikes:**
   - Analyze the financial impact of bird strikes on a yearly basis.

6. **When Do Most Bird Strikes Occur?**
   - Identify the time of day, month, or season when bird strikes are most frequent.

7. **Altitude of Aeroplanes at the Time of Strike:**
   - Analyze the altitudes at which bird strikes typically occur.

8. **Phase of Flight at the Time of the Strike:**
   - Determine the phase of flight (take-off, landing, etc.) during which bird strikes are most common.

9. **Average Altitude of Aeroplanes in Different Phases at the Time of Strike:**
   - Analyze the average altitude during different phases of flight when strikes occur.

10. **Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight:**
    - Examine the consequences of bird strikes on flight operations and safety.

11. **Effect of Strike at Different Altitudes:**
    - Analyze how the impact of bird strikes varies at different altitudes.

12. **Were Pilots Informed? & Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation:**
    - Investigate if prior warnings about bird activity were given and their effect on the outcome of bird strikes.

## Dataset

The dataset provided includes detailed records of bird strikes, including:
- Incident Year
- Operator (Airline)
